# User Stories
## Implemented
Based on the request of our client, we built the following user stores:
- As a user, I want the interface to be easy to use
- As a user, I want to be able to select multiple images I like
- As a user, I want to be able to save locations that interest me
- As a user, I want to be able to see a larger image of recommended locations
- As a user, I want the styling to be clean
- As a user, I want to feel calm when using the site

## Coming Soon
- As a user, I want to be able to save my information to view again later
- As a user, I want the locations I view to show me only less-known locations
